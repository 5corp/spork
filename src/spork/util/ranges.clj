;;Defining Ranges for Solution Representations
;;============================================

;;For normalized domains, [0.0 1.0], we define a little language, based on maps,
;;for encoding the range we'd like to map the normal domain to.  This will make
;;it easy to define potentially complicated n-dimensional solution 
;;representations that have an integer, float, or categorical range associated 
;;with each dimension.  The mapping will be 1:1, so that every member member 
;;of the normal domain maps to a unique member of the range.  That allows us 
;;to convert to and from a normalized representation - for portability and 
;;effecient computation -- for any solution representation we define.  
;;Additionally, the implementation is flexible enough that we can easily derive 
;;sub-representations by varying (i.e. tightening the range) of select 
;;dimensions from a parent specification.  Since maps and vectors serve as the
;;specification protocol, no witchery is needed to overload or derive new 
;;representations.
