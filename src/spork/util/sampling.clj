;;This rose from the "stochastic demand generation" problem that was presented
;;in a somewhat convoluted solution in VBA...
;;The basic process is this: 
;;  We have a population of records P.
;;  We want to define functions that sample from the population, according to 
;;    ad-hoc constraints, to generate samples of records.  These functions are
;;    record-generators, and they typically involve identifying a set of records,
;;    the "template" population, and then modifying the template according to 
;;    some function.  Modification means mapping a function to the template 
;;    population that returns a sampled population (i.e. transforming template
;;    or original records into sampled records).  
;;  We then want to define a sample as a function of a population and a sequence of
;;  or [record-generator, frequency] pairs, that reduces the sequence of one 
;;  generator pairs by applying the record-generator to the population, frequency 
;;  times, accumulating the resulting sample-records.

;;  There is an additional, post-processing phase, where we validate the sample.
;;  A valid sample is a set of records in which:
;;    A set of dependencies between records from the original population P are 
;;    enforced, in that if record A from population P exists in sample S, and
;;   record B from population P is dependent upon A, then record B must also 
;;    exist in S, where 
;;    dependent:: record -> record -> boolean

;;    For two records x1, x2, which are members of an equivalence class, denoted
;;    by equivalent:: record -> record -> boolean
;;    x1 and x2 cannot "intersect", where 
;;      intersection:: record -> record -> boolean
;;    The "distance" between records identified as members of an equivalance 
;;      class  is either 0 or (distance x1 x2) >= (minimum-distance x1 x2) > 0
;;      where
;;      distance :: record -> record -> float
;;      minimum-distance:: record -> record -> float

;;Towards a Language for Describing Sampling Rules
;;================================================

;;We define a little language for building abstract syntax trees that correspond
;;to a computation that...for now....produces a vector of records.

;;The idea is to allow users to build an abstract syntax tree using this 
;;language, which describes a potentially highly complex rule for sampling 
;;from a corpus of records.  Rather than use macros, I implemented specific 
;;data types to provide a "node" for each bit of the language, and provide 
;;a set of combinators that allow us to compose these nodes into a directed 
;;acyclic graph that represents the abstract syntax tree of the rule.  

;;This approach is used throughout computer science, to provide a flexible, 
;;data-driven way to define complex rules.  We gain quite a bit of leverage, 
;;in that we can compose arbitrarily complex rules from simple rules, and 
;;that we can extend the language as-needed by added new primitives and 
;;means of combination.  

;;While adding a layer of complexity (due to the seperate node structures), the 
;;topology for a ruleset is independent of any corpus of samples.  As a result,
;;the composite rule is just another chunk of data, which can be applied in the 
;;context of a sampling evaluation, against ANY corpus of samples.

;;Additionally, since the sampling rule is actually a structure, it is easy to 
;;visualize and debug (unlike a compiled function).  We can even pipe it into 
;;an interactive graph-based program and allow users to visually define their 
;;own sampling rules, or, as-is currently the practice, to define rules using 
;;standard clojure data structures like vectors and maps.  

;;Later, to actually use the sampling rule to derive a sample from some data, 
;;we will define a function that evaluates the sampling rule __in the context__
;;of the corpus of samples.  The effect is that the rule structure is traversed
;;from some root node (possibly specified by the caller), and the leaves of the
;;traversal result in a sampling action.  The sampling action at a particular 
;;leaf node is declaratively defined by the "path" of nodes leading up to 
;;the leaf node.  So we have a simple tree-walker that visits the leaf nodes, 
;;applies the rule to the corpus, and returns all of the samples.

;;__Note__ After reconsidering the initial implementation, I may ditch the 
;;separate node structures in favor of just using lists and macros (more of a 
;;Lispy style, and more elegant).  To be determined...
