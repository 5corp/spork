;;this is a really simple context for prosecuting a discrete event

;;context (or compute a new context).  The simulation proceeds by
;;delivering messages.  Messages are kept in sorted order, by time (not unlike
;;a priority queue).  Entities send messages for delivery to other entities or
;;even themselves.  The simulation proceeds by delivering messages. Note:
;;we can open this up to concurrency constructs later.  For now, it's a nice
;;simple framework for building a toy simulation.

;;This abstraction is pretty minimalist.  We maintain a set of entity
;;state, each with messages.  We're basically simulating a simple actor
;;system.  The pending clock tells us which entities want to be checked,
;;providing us with an ordered list of entities to update.  I'm hoping this
;;provides us with a simple means for locality of reasoning.  Specifically,
;;the entities have an associated set of messages they want to process.

;;a global set of pending events for entities, but we can process them in parallel
