;;Implementation of an auxillary map that is designed to
;;work with an assumably large database, upon which the
;;fields and values of the map are drawn.  This is
;;designed specifically for the use-case of a
;;column-based entitystore, where columns are
;;mappings of entityID to a particular field value.
;;Still, this will work with any abstract mapping,
;;where the "database" is an associative structure
;;of the type {field {id field-value}}, such that
;;(get some-passmap field) will use the backing
;;store to find the field associated with the entity -
;;basically perform a join.
;;As an optimization, we defer joins until necessary,
;;and we cache joins into a persistentmap.  "updates"
;;like assoc, dissoc, etc,. manifest as operations on
;;the cached map, so that the lazy-map will, over time,
;;build up a new map on-demand, and avoid joining all
;;fields of the entity.
(ns spork.data.passmap)

;;We care about adds and drops....right?
;;If we just always assoc a sentinel value when we merge the map,
;;like ::dropped, we can check for it on entity merge...
;;Original design had the entity map diffing based on the fields.
;;We could alternately use a different type of mapentry...
;;Or maintain a hashmap of altered fields, and how they're altered.
;;Having a single mutable hashmap that's shared by all ancestors
;;of the fields could be useful....
;;Basically, since the entity was created, we have a journal of
;;all the modifications that occurred relative to the initial
;;pull....Can we handle dissocing better?  Maybe, explicitly
;;handle dissocing....if we assoc ::drop to the map then
;;on merge it'll get dropped....maybe wrap an acessor around it?
;;Most of the time, we just assoc nil anyway, but sometimes we
;;dissoc...we could always dissoc the db....to indicate inconsistency
;;with the original db, so that on merge, we can compute a diff.
;;alternately, we can define adds and drops...
;;right now, m is === adds, we don't keep track of drops.
;;If we drop a field and add it later, then what...
;;Is there a better way to do a diff?
;;We know from the fields in m which fields were actually
;;read.  We also know, which fields have changed if we
;;keep track of altered.  Currently, we infer that if
;;there's an altered field and not a field in m, that the
;;alteration implies a drop....

;;a passthrough map...a map that references a db of fields in the background to implement its map operations.
;;if we make the assumption that the db contains all possible fields for m, then db is just
;;the means for computing fields in m.  When we drop items from the passmap,
;;we assoc a sentinel value to it, rather than dropping outright (note...we're still
;;paying the cost of associating....)

;;implementing hashing for this guy.  Hashing will force us to flush the
;;backing map, effectively building up the entire map.  At that point, we
;;don't need the backing map anymore...  So it gets ditched.  The new map
;;now fully shadows/contains the old.

;;Cool..for map implementations, we can cheat and use APersistetMap
;;to carry us through...
