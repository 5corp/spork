;;We can be much more efficient in our messaging service if, as we

;;a) looking up the (destination) entity's messages.  
;;Rather than performing a lookup on every message (of which there may be
;;millions, we can chunk the messages out by time.  So, if we collect
;;a batch of messages from a step, after the step is completed (i.e.
;;all entities have pushed out messages), we can commit the messages
;;collectively.
;;Even better, when we send messages from the entity's current time,
;;if the message is "to itself" at the same time, we can treat this
;;message being handled instantaneously instead of queuing it (going
;;through the rigamarole of conjing, dissocing, and all the machinery

;;This is forming a loose protocol for a messaging system....
;;messaging
;;one way to do this is to round-robin the messages.
;;since we're pushing messages to entities, we should know who has pending messages.
;;specifically, which entities need to be updated at the current interval.  That's the
;;old update logic creeping in.


;;We may also have a very small priority queue...so the set of
;;messages may be easily handled via insertion sort rather than using
;;our large-growth queue...That would be far more efficient than
;;going the route where we're paying the cost to balance a red-black tree.


;;we send a message to the mailbox associated with 'to.  We also keep
;;track of the set of units with pending messages.  We could not
;;cache the pending information (and save the cost of maintaining a
;;sorted set on every message push), instead just traverse the entities
;;with mailboxes and check to see if they have messages at each step.
;;That's an option...or, we could be lazy about computing the pending
;;messages (and the pending next-times for the mailboxes)
;;We will refactor this to allow efficient dispatch of immediate
;;messages so that we don't have to keep queuing messages that
;;are happening at the current time.

;;this is a really simple context for prosecuting a discrete event
;;simulation.  We have a global time, a map of entities, and a map of
;;messages for said entities.  From this, we can define a step function,
;;which is composed of entity behaviors, and proceed to update the simulation
;;context (or compute a new context).  The simulation proceeds by
;;delivering messages.  Messages are kept in sorted order, by time (not unlike
;;a priority queue).  Entities send messages for delivery to other entities or
;;even themselves.  The simulation proceeds by delivering messages. Note:
;;we can open this up to concurrency constructs later.  For now, it's a nice
;;simple framework for building a toy simulation.

;;This abstraction is pretty minimalist.  We maintain a set of entity
;;state, each with messages.  We're basically simulating a simple actor
;;system.  The pending clock tells us which entities want to be checked,
;;providing us with an ordered list of entities to update.  I'm hoping this
;;provides us with a simple means for locality of reasoning.  Specifically,
;;the entities have an associated set of messages they want to process.
;;The cool thing here is, we don't have a global event queue.  We maintain
;;a global set of pending events for entities, but we can process them in parallel
;;if we want to.

;;as it stands, we may have overstep our current state.

;;with the current time.  Our typical medium for governing
;;this process is to use the messages, and to return the
;;time remaining as a part of the context.  If the step
;;was incomplete, we can evaluate another step from the
;;outside, using the leftover message from the context.

;;this is on the hot path, so we'll optimize it.

;;really, this is assoc-in using dispatched types.
;;If we make some guarantees about the underlying data
;;structure, namely that it's composed of places, we
;;can get something useful out of it.
;;Namely, places don't change (i.e. they always exist
;;as long as the container exists).

;;Places can be nested paths into objects.

;;In this system, stepping consists of finding all entities with the
;;current time; then processing the entities as a batch.  Note, we
;;can collect messages - to other entities - for dispersal at the
;;end of the individual entity step to allow us to send messages
;;efficiently.

;;The step is conceptually simple; we just pull off the next batch
;;of entities that share the same time coordinate.  The system time
;;becomes that.  We then update the entities (currently sequentially)
;;allowing them to make progress.  The update involves popping the
;;entity's message and sending it to the entity.  Abstractly, the
;;entity has no explicit knowledge of its messages.  During a
;;transaction, it recieves a message and utilizes the subsystem
;;to request the sending of messages to other entities.
;;This is cool;  Entities are interpreters governed by their behavior.
;;They may be seen as continuations as well, or "reactive" functions of
;;time, or state machines, etc.

;;commit entities in a context.

;;can we compose simulators?
