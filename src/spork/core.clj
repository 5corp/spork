;;##Todo
;;Deprecate spork.util.gui
;;Unify cljgui.
;;Isolate externally-dependent modules, spork.incanter, spork.util.excel, 
;;spork.cljgraph, and strip out or modularize apache pio, incanter, 
;;jung dependencies.  

;;Possibly resolve the search parameters from spork.data.search with the 
;;stuff in spork.opt.  I think there's some overlap there and opportunity for
;;re-use.
