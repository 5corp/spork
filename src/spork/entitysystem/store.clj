;;An implementation of an entity store, based on an entity-component
;;architecture.    Might rename this to "CENTS" "Component Entity System"
(ns spork.entitysystem.store
  (:require [clojure.core.reducers :as r]))

;A component-based architecture is a collection of Domains, Systems, Components,
;and entities.  
;
;The central idea behind the architecture is to find a way to decompose the 
;traditional hierarchical, intermixed data and functionality present in many 
;object-oriented designs along orthogonal, domain-specific lines.  
;In the existing simulation framework for Marathon, entities are instances of 
;unitdata or demanddata classes.  They have a significant amount of 
;functionality associated with (and stuck IN) the class.  There is a sense of 
;modularity in the sense that unit policy, behavior, etc. are also objects with 
;independent functions.  However, the design suffers from extensibility due to
;the encapsulation of domain-specific data and functionality, particularly where 
;more than one domain may be accessed.   We have to define the relation between 
;unitdata and policy explicitly in the unitdata class…indiciating that all 
;unitdata objects (and hence unit entities) must have a policy.  We also see 
;data duplication due to encapsulation inside of classes.  Encapsulation also 
;limits the visibility of state data (by design) unless everything is made 
;public.  No longer can we push around collections of primitive data, we must 
;access public members of a class instance (even if we just need a simple 
;container for the class data).  As a result, our notion of classes will become 
;harder to maintain and extend over time….even with less-primitive OOP 
;facilities than in VBA, developing a deep inheritance hierarchy in an OOP 
;system inexorably leads to an inflexible and unwieldy design.
;
;A domain is an orthogonal aspect of the simulated environment upon which 
;reality is partitioned and modeled. To describe a component-based architecture, 
;we probably need to know what components are.   We’ll do a bit of mutual 
;recursion, and rely on another definition to give insight into what a component 
;is.  Components are derived from Domains….so what’s a Domain? Domains are the 
;orthogonal aspects of a simulated environment upon which the environment is 
;partitioned and modeled.   In other words, domains represent clear boundaries 
;between functionality, and enable us to abstract a complicated, tangled 
;environment into a set of unique domains with clearly defined operations for
;each domain, and across said domains.  Domains represent our understanding of
;the unique properties of the environment. 
;
;A component is a collection of functionally-similar, or domain-specific data 
;(traditionally not functions or methods!)  Strictly speaking, components are 
;domain-specific data.   Components derive their meaning from domains because 
;they represent an implicit encoding of domain-specific information.  We can 
;infer from the set of components, which domains are covered by the environment, 
;without having to explicitly state the domains.  This allows for a grass-roots 
;approach to design, in which domains are defined in small pieces, and composed.  
;The smaller and more specific the component, the more obvious the domain 
;context, and the easier it is to factor out duplicate functionality into truly 
;unique data (which reinforces our desire to maintain orthogonal domains).
    
;components define a unique domain, and some data associated with the domain.
;in most setups, data is statically typed, so that the components are homogenous
;we'll follow that practice, but nothing is technically stopping us from having
;heterogenous data across a component.

;;We can also define views that match a particular "type" of entity and

;We define a useful container for entities.  We use this as an initial and

;it's useful to have a logical association of an entity to its components, 
;particularly when creating entities, or when inspecting them.  We use this 
;to get a reified form of the entity as needed.

;I'd like to have a high-level abstraction for querying entities...
;If we treat the entity store as a database, our components are tables.
;Rows/records are the entities in the component's table.


;where should be a function on the entity....not the component.
;if select does its job, the resulting set will be a sequence of reified 
;entities 
  
;When we select entities from an entity store, our building blocks are 
;components.  Components are simple 2-column tables of [entityID data].
;Any predicates used for filtering must be phrased in terms of component
;and entity relationships. 

;Example query -> find the entity nearest to a coordinate, whose name is 
;NOT "Bob".
;(defn get-nearest-visible [id store]

;in peter's work, and in a real db, from tells us which tables to join.
;where applies a predicate to each row in the joined table, indicating if
;the record should be excluded. 
;order-by indicates how to order of the final resulting recordset.

;the entitystore is a simplified datastore.  We can use relational semantics 
;for selection, projection, etc, since we have primary keys in every table. 
;The simplification is that each table is really just a 2-column recordset, 
;where the first field is always the entity's id, or the primary key. 
;The second field can be any kind of data (likely nested, possibly atomic).
;The simplified records are represented as a key-value pair. 
;So the entity store is a simple key-value store. 


;;if we have a flyweight entity, it'd be
;;the id, a pointer to the ces, and any cached components. we currently have.
;;upon reading a component, we update the cache.
;;note: another option is that we develop a cursor type specifically for the entitystore.
;;this provides field-level access to the entity.

;macro to define functions for building stock templates for entities
;allows us to define namespaced functions to build default entities easily.
;I could probably borrow from CLOS here....but I'm not there yet...it'd be 
;nice to have specs belong to pseudo classes and inheritance, but it's 
;really not "that" necessary....all they're doing is defining a set of 
;components for us.  It might behoove us to push this off into a pure data 
;representation as well...Actually, the constructor built by defspec actually
;"looks" like a record anyway...
(defmacro entity-spec
  "Helper macro for composing anonymous entity-building functions.  We can 
   inline these, or formally define them as with defspec.
   
   Formal components declared by defcomponent must be declared ahead of time,

   Component parameterization is not mutually recursive, thus there is currently 
   no shared lexical environment between components.
     
   Inlined or ad-hoc components  can be evaluated as bindings of the form 
   [:component-name component-data] , where component-name is a keyword.

(defmacro defentity
  "Allows composition of a set of components into an entity template.  Creates 
   a function in the current namespace, prefixed with 'build-', taking at least
   one argument - id -  that allows for declaration of entities based on the 
   specification.  id will always be the first argument, but callers may 
   declare more arguments that will become part of lexical environment of 
   the entity building function.  This allows parameterization of entity 
   specifications, where component expressions can be further parameterized if 
   desired. 
   
   Formal components declared by defcomponent must be declared ahead of time,
   but they may be parameterized in the body using arguments supplied by args.
   Component parameterization is not mutually recursive, thus there is currently 
   no shared lexical environment between components.
     
   Inlined or ad-hoc components  can be evaluated as bindings of the form 
   [:component-name component-data] , where component-name is a keyword.
   
   Usage, with defined components and one inline component called playertag:

   (defentity player [id] 
     {:components
       [basicstats {:health 30 :agility 30 :strength 30}
        offense 10
        visage (str The remnant of a lost age, standing alone against evil)
        coords {:x 0 :y 0}
        :playertag :player1]}
       )   
   Yields a function (build-player id) which will create player entities.
   If no arguments are supplied, a single id arg will be inserted.
             
   Alternately, new specs can be derived from existing specs.  If a vector of 
   specs is supplied prior to the components, then a spec-merging function is 
   created to initialize each entity.  The merging function will merge each 
   spec into a new entity (possibly causing side-effects), before adding the 
   components below.  Components with identical domains will retain the last 
   value in the final spec, which is more or less how inheritance typically 
   works.  If the spec is an anonymous spec, as defined by entity-spec, then it 
   will work as well.  This should allow variable means to compose entities, 
   as well as overriding pieces of entity construction.

   An example of another entity leveraging the player spec:  
   (defspec computer-player [aitype name]       
     [player] 
     [:playertag :computer
      :ai aitype])
   This yields a function, (computer-player id aitype name) that 
   produces parameterized computer players."
