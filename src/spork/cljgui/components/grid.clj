;;__TODO__ Rewrite this badboy.  the scenegraph dependency and the asyncdrawing
;;dependency will fail as it is.

;This is a simple library for drawing and interacting with grids.  It's meant to
;serve as the basis for a visualization testbed for various graph searches, but 
;it's got a bunch of uses beyond that.  One of them is to get some practical 
;experience with Swing, and in particular, to test out the Reactive extensions 
;I ported/added via Clojure.

  (:use [spork.clgui.components.swing]
        [spork.cljgui.scenegraph] 
        [spork.cljgui.asyncdrawing]
        [spork.events base observe native]))

;This serves as a testbed for visualizing various graph algorithms, specifically
;shortest paths, etc. 

;What I'd like to do is steal some inspiration from Matt Buckland, and use his 
;excellent examples in his Game AI book.

;Matt's world exists largely in a grid. 
;He breaks up a view into nxn tiles.
;He then defines sets of polygons that fill said world, and act as boundaries
;for any path-finding algorithm. 

;Coordinates in the grid-world are actually centered on a tile.
;This only really matters for drawing purposes.

;an implementation of Bresenham's Line algorithm in clojure.
;In Swing, the mouseDragged event is not polled with high frequency (probably a
;good thing), in that we're not getting per-pixel events....it's based on a 
;time step, and if the mouse moves fast enough, the distance covered in the 
;time step may cause "skipping" to occur, i.e. the next sampled mousedrag may 
;not be adjacent to the previous drag.  For tile-based controls like the Grid, 
;this is pretty important.  As such, we develop an interpolation scheme for 
;quickly generating the "missed" adjacent drags.  Note, this only really matters
;for my grid app, when we're doing things like a "drawing" app.

(defn grid->mvc 
  "Creates a simple, stand-alone grid modelview that is based on a grid.
   Given a grid, we create an asynchronous state-handler (a paint bot from

   has a default pre-renderer built in that draws the grid a graphics arg.  
   This allows us to add shapes to the canvas, while ensuring that the grid 
   is always drawn (i.e. static).  We could move this to a buffered image later,
   but for now it's fast enough!  We also define some useful observable events 
   for the modelview: 
      gridevents - any mousevent that happens over the grid view
      mousedown-xy - a stream of [x y] vectors of mouse panel coordinates 
                     recorded during mouse-dragging (i.e. clicking and holding).
      gridmouse-xy - a stream of [x y] vectors of mouse GRID coordinates  
                     recorded during mouse-dragging.
      panel-click - any click event generated by the left button.  Allows us to 
                    capture use clicks on the grid, as opposed to drags.  

      grid-click - any click event generated by the left button, with x y
