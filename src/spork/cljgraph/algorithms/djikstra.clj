   The implication of a relaxation on sink, relative to source, is that

   So a relaxation can mean one of three things: 
   1: sink is a newly discovered-node (as a consequence of visiting source);
   2: sink was visited earlier (from a different source), but this visit exposes
      a shorter path to sink, so it should be elevated in consideration in 
      the search fringe.
   3: sink is a node of equal length to the currently shortest-known path from 
      an unnamed startnode.  We want to record this equivalence, which means 
      that we may ultimately end up with multiple shortest* paths."

;apply djikstra's algorithm to find the shortest path.  I'm going to slip in 
;bellman-ford as a backup, in case there are negative edgeweights....so that 
;the caller has a single-stop path algorithm to use for most graphs.
