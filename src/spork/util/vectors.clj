;;Vector math stuff.  There are several extremely good vector and linear algebra
;;libraries for clojure, many of which support the highly useful core.matrix 
;;API.  For my use case - and partly as a learning experience - I implement a 
;;small library for working with vectors of primitive doubles.  These are as 
;;fast as working with arrays of doubles, but provide a map-like interface, 
;;thanks to the use of records.


;;Note Feb 2017: the difference between this and spork.util.vecmath is that we
;;implement a concrete datatype here based on arrays.  Not entirely sure
;;if this is any good any more.  Fairly rare in production.
(ns spork.util.vectors)

;;Optimization.  This lets us go faster doing operations on primitives, with 
;;the chance that boned calculations will overflow the data type.
