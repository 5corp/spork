;;This is an attempt to get back to some simple, performant, data

;;Mutable, tabular data is vital for some graph algorithms I'm working
;;on, since we often do updates...

;;An adjacency is a structure that supports adjacency queries on a 
;;set of integers.  This is similar to Haskell's data.graph and other
;;adjacency structures ala C, where we have a simplified numerical 
;;index of nodes, or vertices, and supplemental information informing 
;;their adjacency.  We use definterface to support primitive long 
;;args, i.e. unboxed args.

;;something we want to do for performance reasons is to cut down on
;;the hashing we're relying on for hashmaps.

;;One way to do this is to have an indexed graph representation.
;;We also want to return vectors when we compute neighbors, since
;;we can traverse them much faster than lazy sequences.

;;So, we probably want to build a library of eager vector functions 
;;that mirror the sequence lib.

;;That would comport with the array lib from f#, serving roughly (not 
;;exactly) the same purpose.

;;This is more dynamic.  We have numerical indices, and object costs.
