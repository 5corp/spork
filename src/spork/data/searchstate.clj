;;Module for defining generic graph search data.  Uses the generic fringe 
;;structures from spork.data.fringe, to provide a generic search state.
;;We'll typically use this with priority queues, for djikstra's algorithm and 
;;the bellman-ford algorithm, but depth-first, breadth-first, and random 
;;searching are also supported.

(defn- relax*
  "Given a shortest path map, a distance map, a source node, sink node, 
   and weight(source,sink) = w, update the search state.  

   The implication of a relaxation on sink, relative to source, is that 
   source no longer exists in the fringe (it's permanently labeled).  
   So a relaxation can mean one of three things: 
   1: sink is a newly discovered-node (as a consequence of visiting source);
   2: sink was visited earlier (from a different source), but this visit exposes
      a shorter path to sink, so it should be elevated in consideration in 
      the search fringe.
   3: sink is a node of equal length to the currently shortest-known path from 
      an unnamed startnode.  We want to record this equivalence, which means 
      that we may ultimately end up with multiple shortest* paths."
