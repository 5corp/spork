   1: sink is a newly discovered-node (as a consequence of visiting source);
   2: sink was visited earlier (from a different source), but this visit exposes
      a shorter path to sink, so it should be elevated in consideration in 
      the search fringe.
   3: sink is a node of equal length to the currently shortest-known path from 
      an unnamed startnode.  We want to record this equivalence, which means
