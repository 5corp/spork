;;A set of utilities and protocols shared between AI behavior implementations.
;;Note: this is infrastructure designed to support the implementation of entity
;;behavior in general simulations (i.e. games, analytic simulations, etc.).
;;Thus, we are not referring to classical AI realms such as search and (necessarily
;;planning), although the facilities provided here may be used as such.  The goal is
;;to provide a common interface through which multiple AI implementations may work and
;;cooperate.

;;Not sure we actually need this.  We might be better off letting contexts define their
;;own blackboard and just let the trees/fsms work on the context.

;;Coordination
;;============
;;The primary communication/referential mechanism is a blackboard
;;abstraction.  The blackboard serves as a conceptual backplane for the propogation of
;;facts to support reasoning.

;;Not really a fan of using extend-protocol, since we end up
;;getting implementation lookup costs.  Maybe we just define
;;as-bb, and define ID for types that implement blackboard semantics
;;precisely.  The other option is to detect map at runtime and dispatch
;;based on that.  We're also duplicating functionality based on maps.
;;We can just use get/assoc, and force the type to handle the semantics
;;(i.e. mutation vs. other stuff). or....
;;we can define a specific blackboard type.
