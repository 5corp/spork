;;A collection of libraries for implementing population-based
;;stochastic optimization methods, i.e. Genetic Algorithms,
;;Evolutionary Algorithms.  The terms have become somewhat
;;interchangeable, so if you see me using them I mean the process of
;;optimizing a population of solutions based on some notion of
;;fitness, selection, and a stochastic process that creates new
;;candidate solutions.

;;genetic algorithms will tend to look similar to our generic solution
;;representations.  They will be generically encoded as real valued
;;vectors.  Optionally, we may choose to use a bitvector encoding, but
;;we'll currently with RVV.

;;To get a simple genetic algorithm together, we need a few things: 
;;A means of reproduction, selection, and fitness. 
;;I will follow Sean Luke's excellent treatise in Essentials of
;;Metahueristics.

;;Sean describes an abstract evolutionary algorithm in terms of how it 
;;defines a population, assesses the fitness of a population, selects 
;;individuals from a previous population for "breeding", breeds
;;individuals, and joins the results of breeding into the new
;;population.

;;We'll assume that individuals are homogenous (i.e. the same
;;dimension) real valued vectors.  Thus, a population is merely a
;;collection of these vectors.  This makes our fitness function easy
;;to define as well: it's simply a mapping of a real valued vector to
;;a floating point value.

;;Most results of genetic algorithms will return a map of useful 
;;information.

;;Both selection and breeding are pretty diverse topics.  We'll allow 
;;the caller to define specific implementations for both.  Breeding,
;;in general, maps a population to another population.  Selection is 
;;usually a function that maps a population to a sub-population.
;;We use selection, however it's performed, to provide an initial
;;population argument for breeding.  Breeding returns a set of
;;new candidates derived from the initial population (somehow).  The
;;result of breeding is then passed to a join operator, which
;;integrates the new population with the old.

   criterion is met.  Fitness is inferred to mean more fit = higher value.

   individuals compared by fitness will prefer a higher fitness value.  In 
   the context of ga, I think it's more intuitive.  Callers need to enforce
   this mechanism.  Note: both breeding and joining will likely involve some 
   form of selection, however the implementation is up to the caller."
