;;We can get a significant performance boost (x 5) by eliminating the call
;;to vec in the implementation of -get-sinks and -get-sources for
;;spork.data.digraph.digraph - just return the resulting list.
;;[done]

;;Also, I use ordered maps for the digraph.
;;These are about 2x as slow for seq instancing as normal maps...
;;Another optimization is to eliminate ordered maps and just use {} 
;;That lets us use array maps where possible (dictated by the
;;runtime).

;;Note -> did a quick test without the ordered-map backing the graph, 
;;and runtime savings were slight for walks.  Since walks are a worst
;;case scenario, I assume the ordered map in not currently a
;;significant hotspot.

;;We only really need ordered traversal for tree operations...
;;Thus, I don't think the ordered graph should be the default.
;;There's overhead incurred every time there...

;;Another likely performance killer is the priorityq implementation
;;for the search fringes. 

;;For our pq, I built an alter value function that allows us to
;;reweight the node on the priority queue.  This is potentially a
;;performance bottleneck, since I find a persistent queue associated
;;with the priority, then traverse that queue to filter out the old
;;node.  This could take o(n) time worst case, where n is the length
;;of the queue...For PFS or Dijkstra, we really don't use the PQ in
;;isolation; i.e. we have a distance map that we're maintaining.  So,
;;we can avoid removing items from the queue as a consequence of
;;re-weighing; we'll automatically ignore them if they show up on the
;;fringe again with a higher distance.  We can basically just add them
;;to the fringe and not worry about removing AND updating.

;;Fringes, in general, will be transient in nature: They only exist to
;;facilitate the search.  Since we want searches to be as fast as
;;possible, we probably want to use mutable structures for the
;;fringes. That should be an assload faster. 


;;ArraySeq is the biggest bottleneck at the moment, even for the
;;comparatively simple depth-first-search.


;;Looking at using fast, mutable structures for search fringes.
