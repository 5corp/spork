;;A little aux library for doing data diffs..

;;can we perform an efficient entity-diff in the entity-store
;;library?, or do we have to go the long route?
;;Also...how long is the long route...

;;Also, if we diff this way, how does that play out when
;;we're using mutation?
;;Since it's a store, we really just care about which keys
;;changed in the component/entity mappings.
;;That's what we'll serialize.  Should cut down on our
;;problems significantly.  And, we can cache diffs in the
;;future to make this easier, maybe.
