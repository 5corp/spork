;;Our basis-tree is a minimum spanning tree, with the property 
;;that edges in the tree have a reduced cost of 0 (they are basic 
;;in simplex parlance). 

;;The general idea is to find a basic solution, which implies 
;;arcs outside of the basis.  We choose an arc outside of the 
;;basis and add it to the tree.  Adding it to the tree forms 
;;a cycle (since it's an MSP), which means we push flow 
;;along the cycle - ala cycle cancelling.  Some arc in the 
;;cycle is guaranteed to drop since flow is push.  So...we 
;;drop the arc, and recompute node potentials.  Then choose 
;;another arc outside of the tree.

;;When choosing an arc outside the tree, we can only choose arcs 
;;that will induce a negative-cost cycle in the basis.  What 
;;would do that?  Since the RC of every edge in the basis-tree 
;;is zero, we want to pull in an arc that, when flow is pushed 
;;along it, will result in a negative cost (.i.e improving the 
;;objective) in the residual network.

;;Since arcs may flow forward or backward, we are looking for 
;;forward, fully capacitated arcs that have positive reduced cost
;;(implying a backward residual arc with NEGATIVE cost), 
;;or empty arcs with negative reduced cost (implying a forward 
;;residual arc with NEGATIVE reduced cost).

;;We have an optimal flow if we cannot find an eligible arc.

;;The consequence here is that we are flipping through simplex 
;;bases, where the bases correspond to MSP trees for the flow network, 
;;transitions between trees force an arc out of the network and into 
;;either the Full or Empty arc set, while swapping in an arc from the 
;;Full or Empty arc set.

;;Each MSP has a unique set of vertex potentials.  So when we 
;;build an MSP (or mutate one), we need to recompute the vertex
;;potentials.

;;Actually, we need to recompute vertex potentials iff the old
;;potentials were affected.  There are cases where we will modify 
;;the MSP, but dependent potentials are unaffected (i.e. they are 
;;still good), so we can avoid recomputing all vertex potentials 
;;every time.

;;All we have to do to compute potentials is start at any node, 
;;traverse up through its parents, then when we hit the root (a node 
;;with no parent), we assign a potential to the parent (typically
;;-inf) and traverse back through the children assigning potentials.

;;Given rc(u,v) = cost(u,v) - (phi(u) - phi(v)) 
;;If we assume rc(u,v) = 0, for edges along the tree, 
;;then 0 = cost(u,v) - (phi(u) - phi(v))
;;     0 = cost(u,v) - phi(u) + phi(v)
;;     phi(u) - cost(u,v) = phi(v)

;;So, computing potentials for a child v relative to a parent u, for
;;any edeg (u,v) within the basis tree is:
;;     phi(v) = phi(u) - cost(u,v) 


;;Since we are working with trees, when we add an edge to the basis
;;tree, we create a cycle between the two vertices on the edge (by 
;;virtue of the fact that the tree is in fact a MSP).  Since we 
;;intend to push flow across this cycle, we need to know what the 
;;cycle is. So, we exploit the tree structure to find the least common 
;;ancestor of both nodes.  The paths from each node to the least 
;;common ancestor (plus the edge u v) define the minimum cycle.

;;Determine the least common ancestor of two nodes in a tree, or the 
;;root of the smallest subtree that contains both nodes. Basically 
;;just trace up the parents until we find a common node, i.e. until 
;;we run into the first node that's already been visited.

;;Once we have the ability to find the least common ancestor in the
;;spanning tree, we need to be able to swap out edges.  One of the
;;edges on the cycle will be saturated (i.e. fully capacitated or 
;;fully drained), and it will be moved to the L or U set of edges.


;;So, given an LCA, and two nodes, we know we can augment along the 
;;path. that forms their cycle.  This is identical to our augmentation 
;;from netflow, and we can probably use the same algorithm.

;;Once we push flow along the edges, we find that - one or more 
;;edges - is a leaving edge.

;;Given a minimum spanning tree, an edge to add, and a edge to be dropped, can we 
;;alter the tree? 

;;a substitution is just dropping the edge, adding the new edge, 
;;then flipping the nodes between the to of the new edge and the 
;;to of the old edge

;;currently a bottleneck, although it may not matter since 
;;we "should" not be doing tons of augmentations.

;;Can we traverse lower and upper arcs? 
;;Lower arcs are arcs not on the basis that have no flow.
;;Upper arcs are arcs not on the basis that have no capacity.

;;If implement Danztig's rule, we scan all the arcs for the greatest 
;;reduced price.  Note -> we have to do that anyway to determine
;;optimality.

;;Another option is to maintain two arc sets.  
;;Since the residual network is stored implicitly, we can also 
;;store our bounded arcs implicitly.  Either that, or we 
;;can directly link to them.

;;Since we only maintain forward arcs for the undirected network
;;explicitly, backward (or residual) arcs are implied.  We store
;;keys that assoc to them when they exist, but the pointer goes to the 
;;forward arc. 

;;So all arc modifications are done on forward arcs.  The API takes 
;;care of understanding what it means to push a directional flow 
;;along an arc (i.e. it will infer that the arc is backward based on 
;;the direction we're going).

;;So we can push arcs between L and U. 
;;We can maintain three sets of forward arcs, T, L, U.
;;Arcs in T are on the basis, (forward and residual)
;;Arcs in L are zero-flow, off the basis. (not residual)
;;Arcs in U are full-flow, off the basis. (not residual)

;;Prior to pivoting, we need to identify the entering arc.
;;Assume we can do this...(get-entering-arc s) 
;;Then we identify the cycle.... 
;;(find-cycle (get-entering-arc s) (get-spt s))
;;Then we augment along the cycle, returning an augmentation:
;;(augment-cycle s (find-cycle (get-entering-arc s) (get-spt s)))
;;=> {:augmented-flow n :entering some-arc :leaving some-arc :net altered-network}


;;So, the first cut is to collect arcs that are off the basis.
;;We do this when we initially build the simplex.
;;traverse the SPT and collect arcs that are off the basis.
;;Initially, all non-basic arcs will be in L (zero flow). 

;;The only changes to membership between T, L, and U will happen
;;after augmentation, when an entering and leaving arcs are 
;;identified. 

;;One idea is to uniquely number all arcs, and only shift the 
;;ints around.  We would need to store the int->arc mapping.
;;This would allow us to have a nice hash-map though...
