;:A mutable priorityq implmentation that supports 
;;dynamic re-weighing of keys, as well as operations on 
;;the front and back of the queue (a double-ended queue).
;;Designed for use in general priority queue operations like
;;Dijkstra's algorithm, and for bounded priority queue applications
;;like Beam Search.
(ns spork.data.mpq
  (:require [spork.protocols [core :as core]]))

;;So, an alternative is to provide a mutable priority queue, based 
;;around a treeset.  We can provide some convenience functions to 
;;allow us to cache the min and max elements.  Additionally, 
;;treeset already provides operations for polling the lowest and 
;;highest elements respectively.  For a pure PQ, it'd be nicely
;;implemented  as a leftist heap, or using a 2-3 fingertree. 

;;In our use case for priority fringes, we should be able to 
;;discern the need to re-weigh upon relaxation. 
;;We only ever have one instance of a node on the fringe, and
;;if it's on the fringe, it has a best-known-distance.
;;So if we want to re-weigh the node on the fringe, we 
;;only need to check to see if there's a corresponding 
;;[best-known-weight node] in the treeset. 
;;If so, then we remove the [best-known-weight node] and conj
;;the [new-best-weight node] onto the treeset.
;;That should maintain the invariant that we're looking for, 
;;and allow us to re-weigh nodes on the priority fringe.
;;So, in order to re-weigh the old, you have to know the 
;;old weight.  Another option is to simply maintain a 
;;hashmap of active nodes and the current weight.

;;queue, but we have to finagle the comparer.  Lack of proper
;;finagling means that we can have unintended consequences in things
;;like dijkstra, where we find a path to the destination node and
;;end up re-weighting it, unintentionally visiting it over a
;;pre-existing node with the same cost, the preference due to
;;the fact that the destination node's value compares as less than.
;;To fix this, we force the pq to "break ties" by always decalring
;;greater than.
