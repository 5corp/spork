;;Placeholder for a mutable backend for the simulation
;;infrastructure, namely event propogation.  We may never
;;need this.  We "may" want to in the case of async or
;;parallel event propogation possibilities.  Additionally,
;;we can use contemporary (circa 2017) libraries like
;;core.async and others to accomplish this elegantly.
