;build a structure and operations to define a quadtree.
;for geometric primitives.

;a quadtree is a hierarchical data structure that subdivides a 2 dimensional
;space into 4 sub regions of equal area.  Note, the regions may be square or 
;rectangular, depending on the bounds of the root.

;changed the implementation....
;instead of an items vector 4 keys, just have an items map.
;this makes things more generic...

;Note this is one implementation, based on spatial leaves and nested trees. 
;We could just as easily define a geohash function that spatially hashes our 
;2d plane, and inserts items as [k v] pairs into an associative structure like
;a hashmap.
