;;__Abstract Trend Type__
;;We'll work with trends a lot, specifically live or dynamic trends.  These trends
;;are typically (x,y) cartesian coordinates associated with trend-name.

;;One common idiom is to use "slices" to dynamically update the latest points in the trend.
;;If we think of a time series, with the "Right" edge being the latest point in the series,
;;we can add a slice of points - across multiple trends - efficiently.  This is primarily to
;;ease the cost of drawing and redrawing trends.  Depending on the underlying implementation,
;;we may retain only the current trendline, or we may dynamically recompute the trends in
;;some fashion.  Either way, adding "slices" of trends at a particular time is useful.

;;__Stacked Area Charts__

;;A stacked area chart is pretty easy too....
;;If we're careful.
;;We can make it dynamic pretty simply as well, probably loads faster than
;;jfreechart.  We're just filling in a polygon over time.  Actually, we're
;;drawing lines over time, and not erasing them....so, all we "really"
;;have to do is figure out how to draw a slice, and then advance multiple
;;slices across a canvas that doesn't erase (basically drawing to a
;;dirty buffer)
