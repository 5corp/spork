(ns spork.data.priorityq
  "The priorityq implementation is designed for use as an auxillary data
   structure.  It relies on the sorted-map from clojure.core, although I might 
   shift the implementation to use priority-map later.  The current 
   implementation maps a set of weights (keys in the sorted-map), to sequences
   of values.  This rises from the fact that many values may share the same 
   priority or weight.  Weight is assumed to be, although not enforced, a 
   numeric value, typically a floating point value.")


;;note, this persistent PQ is no longer in favor, because most of our 
;;usage for pq's are motivated by search algorithms.  I made the
;;mistake of defaulting to java.util.PriorityQueue for a search 
;;fringe, and while initially useful, I realized I was generating 
;;a lot of garbage by not updating/re-weighing the value of entries 
;;in the queue.  Note that the j.u.pq doesn't provide operations for 
;;re-weighing either.
