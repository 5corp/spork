;;We use an interface here for a reason....
;;An interface allows direct method invokation on 
;;anything that's cast to the interface; so we can 
;;uniformly access containers with field access 
;;akin to .field 
;;If we use protocols, we incur about a 2-4x slowdown.
;;With the interface, we actually get close to 
;;array access speeds, so it's preferable.  The only 
;;downside is that the API gets a bit wonkier.

;;I only recommend doing this for limited use cases, 
;;i.e. where we are trying to unify a protocol over 
;;multiple implementations (due to mutation efficiencies).
;;For the most part, protocols are pretty damn good, and 
;;the run-time type dispatch cost, particularly for inlined 
;;protocols, is unlikely to be a bottleneck.  For performance 
;;and uniform field-like access, interfaces are lower level 
;;and more performant.   [insert pithy observation about 
;;premature optimization here]
