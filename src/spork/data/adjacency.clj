;;Another option is to abstract out the functionality common to many
;;algorithms...

;;In sedgewick's design for network flows, he maintains two arrays,
;;similar to my source and sinks design.

;;These arrays serve as handles to the same data structure...
;;the Edge, or some kind of edge representation. 

;;The implication is that an edge in sources is adjacent to sinks.
;;We get an edgeinfo, and then execute queries depending on the 
;;edge info.  Sedgewick speaks in terms of residual flow, and 
;;flowing "toward" a vertex across an edge. 

;;This lets us ignore directionality, as it's directly encoded 
;;in the edge already.
 

;;Another option is to return a vector...
;;That satisfies the int mapping.

;;So a decent structure could be...
;;adj-vectors 
;;[0 [1 2]
;; 1 [3] ] 

;;adj-list 
;;'(0 (1 2))
;;'(1 (1 2))

;;optionally, a weighted-adj-list 
;;'(0 ((1 w01) (2 w02)))

;;or an edge list
;;[[from to w]
;; [from to w]
;; [from to w]]


;;Pair this with an 0(1) access structure, like a map.
;;Or a vec.

;;We just maintain two adjacencies...

;;Really, all an adjacency needs to do is implement forward-looking
;;adjacencies.
;;We can maintain backward-looking adjacencies using the same
;;structure, with inverted args as an optimization.

;;An array-backed adjacency table.  Connectedness is determined by weight.

;;sedgwick proposes a simpler design.
;;we have a common edgeinfo data structure, ala einfo.
;;Rather than storing two adjacency maps with weights, 
;;we assume the network is undirected, and share 
;;edge-infos between two adjacency lists.
;;He uses a bag (dunno why), but effectively has
;;an adjacency list for each vertex in the network, 
;;ordered by v (froms) and w (tos). 
;;The same edgeinfo datastructure is stored in each list though.
;;So you get the bennies of sparseness and mutation.
;;You also get the ability to see which edges are 
;;adjacent to w or v, and determine direction with a simple
;;check (is v identical to from in the edgeinfo?) 

;;I think that eliminates the edge-info queries.
;;If the structure of the network is not changing drastically, 
;;then we're golden...We also have a single pointer to the 
;;edge info, if we're using mutable edge infos.  That 
;;should be a big win...both sparseness and mutation.

;;if we have a structure that captures adjacencies...
