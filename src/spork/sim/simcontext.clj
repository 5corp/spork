;A simulation context is a general purpose structure for bearing discrete event
;simulation information, specifically a scheduler, an updater, event-routing/
;event registration (propogation), and the simulation state.

;The simulation context defines the dependencies in the simulation, as well as 
;the pending instantaneous changes (event), and the notion of time or an 
;absolute ordering of the computation in the simulation.

;The scheduler is just an agenda value from sim.agenda.  Its purpose is to 
;provide a focus for ordering events.  In the observer-based, mutation-driven 
;style of old, we would "trigger" events in functions, which would communicate
;the presence of an event along the event stream by broadcasting an
;instantaneous event.  In the newer functional styling, "triggering" an event 
;should amount to pushing an event onto the simulation context.  We can then
;handle instantaneous events by threading an event-handling function in between
;each of the main simulation process functions....thus allowing for an absolute
;ordering of events (even instantaneous events) as they are queued.

;Scheduling is typically used to "wake" entities within the simulation at 
;specified times, or to indicate that a set of simulation processing needs to 
;occur.  

;The updater allows us to encode localized updates or patches to entities, 
;and to keep track of the last "time" an entity was updated.  For temporal 
;simulations, this is valuable as it provides efficient, localized updating 
;of entities, and keeps the system consistent (i.e. prevents the application of
;old time-dependent updates with outdated notions of elapsed time).
;Much of the simulation domain requires time deltas to compute the next step 
;of the simulation, or to define an entity's behavior, so keeping track of 
;this is fairly useful.

;Event routing information encodes a communications network, represented by an 
;event-network from sim.pure.network.  For every simulation, there is a 
;vocabulary used to communicate changes in the simulation or to trigger 
;side-effects (rendering or logging for instance). The propogator describes a 
;network of named events, and for each event, an ordered set of subscribers that 
;are "interested" in the event. We typically handle this with an 
;observable/observer setup, which encodes an event as an enumerated type, 
;mapping every event to a list of oberservers who need to be notified when an 
;event is observed.  We can simulate this setup in a pure manner, by maintaining 
;the same dependency map, and - rather than broadcasting the event, fold the 
;event and the simulation state through the handlers in series.

;The rest of the namespace defines an API for creating, querying, and modifying
;abstract simulation contexts.

;it'd be really nice if we had a simple language for describing updates...

;We can take advantage of that...just use events...
  ;unit-update can pass new units around...
  ;supply handler would be in charge of integrating update...

;Another idea is to leverage the global-state nature of the simstate..
;treat it as a nested datastructure (which we currently do), 
;define a nice API for updating paths in the structure.

;This is going back to the entitystore route...

;maybe a macro, like a sim monad?
