;We represent a scene as a nested datastructure (duh, this is lisp after all), 
;using clojure records.  Records were chosed due to their speed, nice features,
;and the automatic 'typing' and inline protocol implementation.  Each element
;of the scene graph will have one or more unique arguments for its specific 
;role, with a final argument that consists of the "rest" of the scene, i.e. 
;nil, or some other IScene.  

;Each structure corresponds to an operation on the scene context, which under 
;the hood, is a transformation applied to the mutable Java2D graphics object 
;that the scene is being rendered to.  The scene itself is merely a structure, 
;that is traversed depth-first when called by render with a graphics object 
;as an arg.  Since we're dealing with a mutable Java2D graphics context under 
;the hood, which is essentially a state machine, the rendering implementations 
;for each element of the scene graph are careful to 'undo' their operations 
;on the graphics object after rendering themselves and their children.  This 
;keeps the rendering context effectively immutable, and keps the declared 
;structure of the scene consistent.  

;As we traverse the directed acyclic graph that describes the scene, any path 
;in the graph describes an ordered list of transforms to apply to any graphics 
;context, with leaf or terminal nodes resulting in actual rendered images or 
;shapes.  Since each node in the graph is an IScene, all nodes have a unified
;interpretation of draw from the IScene protocol, and we can draw the entire 
;scene (traverse the graph in order, drawing each node as we go) by calling 
;our render function on the root node of the scene.

;Note - this implementation is somewhat lacking for high-performance apps like 
;2D games or million-point animated data plots, because it's NOT leveraging all
;of the effeciencies of scene-graphs.  Future versions will include spatial 
;information in the scene graph to allow us to query and update (re-render) only
;portions of the scene that have changed.  This ends up being drastically more 
;efficient and scaleable.  For our purposes, on modern hardware the current 
;implementation is fast enough and can handle fairly complex scenes 
;instantaneously.  For games or demand scientific visualization (particularly 
;with Java2D's slooow alpha blending), we'd need to render the scene graph to 
;alternative graphics contexts as well, basically OpenGL.  There are several 
;nice libraries for this, including PulpCore, Slick2D, JOGL, LWJGL, and LibGDX.

;the function can be "read" by the reader, and turned right back into a 
;clojure record.  This means that we can trivially serialize our scenes as

   either contracts [for small sizes] or expands [for larger sizes] the spread
   of the points.  growthf determines how fast the radius of the spiral grows 
   as a function of time (if user supplies (fn [t] 1.0) then only a circle is 
   rendered).  direction describes whether the spiral appears to originate from 
   the edge of the screen, zooming toward the center, or vice versa.  plotf 
   is the renderer for each coordinate of the spiral, typically faded points."
