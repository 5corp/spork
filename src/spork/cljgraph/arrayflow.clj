;;we can cheat here and use a really small array as our flow
;;network.  This should allow us cheap updates for dynamic arcs..
;;The majority of our structure is actually a static array.
;;The supply network is effectively static.
;;Our network will have the same topological ordering of nodes.
;;Nodes [0..k] will always be the same supply nodes.
;;Node k + 1 will be the SRC node
;;and node k + 2 will always be the fill node.
;;Thus, we can define a dynamic graph and use mutation to get a huge
;;speed boost.  Plus, neighbor searches should be friggin' fast.
