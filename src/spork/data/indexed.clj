;;Graph-Backed Indexed Data Structures
;;====================================

;;The indexed-tree is a data structure the provides tree-like access to a 
;;topology, based on a pre-determined root-node for the tree.
(deftype indexed-tree [root-node topology]
  IGraphable 
  (-get-graph [t] topology)
  clojure.lang.IObj  
  (meta [this]   (meta topology))  
  (withMeta [this m]    
    (indexed-tree. root-node (with-meta topology m)))
  IIndexedTree 
  (tree-root [t] root-node)
  (append [t other] 
    (indexed-tree. root-node 
       (toptree/append-tree t root-node other (tree-root other))))
  (prune [t k] (toptree/prune-tree t k)))

;;TODO -> implement this using vectors.  Also, get it working like an indexed
;;list, kind of like a persistent vector.

;;double lists are effectively doubly-linked lists, and represented as very 
;;simple graphs. double lists should act as a typical persistent list, i.e. 
;;supporting operations to conj, cons, etc., with the caveat that we maintain a
;;topology of the parent-child relations...

;;An entirely different way to go about this enterprise...
;;This is much simpler....but more limited...create doubly-linked vectors.
;;Or a doubly-linked tries.  Use vectors to encode parent/child relations.
