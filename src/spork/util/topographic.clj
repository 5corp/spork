;;A work-in-progress-library for persistent indexed data structures that 
;;retain some notion of topology.  Things like bi-directional trees, and 
;;doubly-linked lists, and basically any imperative structure using pointers 
;;should be feasible to represent by the graph-backed data structures here.

;;This library arose after realizing that, in fact, you do need 
;;navigable structures.  In particular, for things like scene-graphs and other 
;;logical hierarchies, changes to the structure typically happen at the leaves,
;;and must propogate data upward.  In this case, zippers don't quite work - 
;;although they could if you built one for each leaf.  Imperative structures 
;;typically handle this problem implicitly via pointers, or parent/child 
;;references.  That way, when a child needs to propogate information up, or a 
;;parent need to propogate down, you just follow the references. 

;;In the library, I implemented the imperative pointer-backed topology 
;;explicitly via a persistent data structure built from canonical clojure maps
;;and stuff.  The explicit topology is then encoded in a general graph, over 
;;which we place multiple functional facades, including doubly-linked lists, 
;;and bi-directional trees.  This provides a familiar, persistent alternative to 
;;imperative structures.
;;I need to rework the name of the library, as it is no longer a topographic
;;list.
