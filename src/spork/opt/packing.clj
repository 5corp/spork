;;An implementation of generic packing problem instances, i.e.
;;knapsack.  Currently used to implement packing problem solvers 
;;via dynamic programming, so that packing can be composed.

;;Note: Looks like an experiment.  MARKED FOR DEPRECATION.
(ns spork.opt.packing
  (:require [clj-tuple :refer [tuple]]))

;;this is a sample implementation.
;;We should be able to pull out some nice scaffolding from it.
