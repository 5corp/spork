;Defined a simple protocol for agendas.  The operations on schedules are 
;similar to Abelson and Sussman's agenda from Structure and Interpretation of 
;computer programs.  The difference is that we allow one to bound the time 
;horizon (in the case of a desire to truncate the processing of events on the 
;schedule).

  (agenda-count [a] "Return the count of the items on the agenda.")

;;We have some overhead in the calls to current-time on this guy,
;;since it delegates to first-event.  If we could cache the
;;first event, we don't have to do the traversal over and
;;over, which saves us a lot of time.  So, the typical
;;option is to have a mutable value that serves as a one-time
;;cache, where if we ask for the first event, we save it behind
;;the scenes and cache the value (like a thunk).
;;We can use a single-cell object array to act as our mutable
;;value...that'd be compatible with our serialization...
;;The cached version is significantly faster at access the
;;head event now.
