;;at the end of the day, we want a simple sequence of comparisons to combine.
;;not unlike parser combinators, or other little grammars.

;;a comparison rule can be:
;;|f:: a -> a -> comparison
;;|{:key-fn f} :: map (a, (a->b))
;;|{:compare-fn f}     :: map (a, (a->a->comparison))
;;So we use comparison-type as a dispatch function for a multimethod.
;;We'll read in "specs" to parse a comparer, and use this build our comparers 
;;up from specs (functions, or maps of {:key-fn f}|{:compare-fn f}
