;;This is a semi-port of the stochastic optimization algorithms
;;presented in Toby Segaran's excellent 'Collective Intelligence'
;;book. Segaran does a good job generalizing numerical optimization 
;;problems into a protocol-friendly format, which I found amenable 
;;to Clojure.
;;Toby breaks them down into a cost function, a domain, and a solution.  
;;In _this_ port, I define a general solution environment, as well as a 
;;protocol to view the solution environment as a solveable problem.  
;;Mechanisms for searching the problem are encoded in the solution 
;;environment, and allow for hot-swapping, inheriting, or otherwise
;;tweaking solution strategies, solution representations, and any
;;other aspect of the stochastic optimization.  This is pretty useful,
;;since we have a number of strategies (from hill-climbing, to
;;simulated annealing, to tabu search, to genetic algorithms, etc.)
;;that we will impliment and use.  Having a simple, general purpose
;;optimization engine means that we can extend the solution
;;environment to include parameters specific to a strategy, and to
;;decouple the solution representation.

;;Generic Problem Solving
;;=======================
;;We want a way to define data structures as valid representations of
;;solutions.  Representing solutions is one of the most variable bits
;;of any optimization process.  What functions do we need to support?
;;A means to get the current solution.
;;A means to cost any arbitray solution (a cost function, possibly
;;relative to a solution or solution(s)).
;;A way to find neighboring solutions.
;;A way to tap into problem-specific parameters for the solver to use.

;;__ISolveable__ is a protocol for describing useful information relevant
;;to a problem solving strategy, as well as the basic transforms
;;necessary to derive a solution.
