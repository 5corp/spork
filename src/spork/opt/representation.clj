;;Solution Representations
;;========================
;;Solutions can take on a ton of different representation forms, each one 
;;custom to a specific problem domain.  However, we can build a language for 
;;defining solutions that consist of n-dimensional components, where each 
;;component can be an integer, a real number, or a function that maps 
;;integers to discrete values (i.e. a vector, a map, a set, etc.)  This will 
;;allow trivial solution representation definitions, as well as constraint 
;;definitions later on.

;;Ideally, we want a high-level means to map an n-dimensional point of 
;;values, ranging between [0.0 1.0], into a solution representation.
;;That way, we can just write a single normalized neighborhood function 
;;that can turn into a discrete solution.

;;Our primary solution representation will be as an abstract vector of doubles.
;;These protocols allow us to define efficient encoders and decoders.
(defprotocol IDoubleVectorEncoder
  (encode-doublevector [e s] "Maps s to an IDoubleVector."))
(defprotocol IDoubleVectorDecoder
  (decode-doublevector [d dvec] "Maps an IDoubleVector to another domain."))

;;We will use a supplementary library, implemented in __collective.vectors__ to 
;;handle defining and manipulating arbitrary vectors in an efficient manner.

;;Solution Perturbation (I said Perturbation, sicko!) 
;;===================================================

;;At the highest level of abstraction, we want to define means for altering or 
;;changing solution representations to facilitate the search process.  One 
;;practical and general means of perturbing solutions, particularly solutions
;;with an encoding to normalized vectors, is to add an n-dimensional float 
;;vector to the normalized vector representation of the solution.  

;;For some types, we want to allow a means for quickly munging through 
;;perturbations.  For purely numerical represenations, for instance, we might 
;;just be performing primitive arithmetic to perturb the solution, if the 
;;solution representation is a double vector as well.  In that case, applying 
;;native operations would be much much faster, and facilitated via
;;internal-perturb.  If implementors define solutions that satisfy the protocol, 
;;the encoding/decoding process will be bypassed.
