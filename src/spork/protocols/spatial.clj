;Tom Spoon 16 June 2012 -> A clojure library for spatial data structures

;;Generally, we'll be dealing with a class of data structures that have the 
;;ability to partition an n-dimensional space, contain information about items
;;in the space, and to support several forms of spatial queries about items
;;in the space.  

;;In general, space is of arbitrary dimensionality.  How a spatial container 
;;subdivides space is irrelevant.  All that is relevant is that the spatial 
;;container knows how to conjoin items.

;;Going to generalize here..
;;We typically have a notion of bounds as they pertain to 2 or 3 dimensions.
;;Certain data structures, like KD trees an


;Starting with QuadTrees.
;Then bounding volume hierarchies.

;;Some geometric primitives.  I'll probably port these to a more general lib, 
;;but they live here for now.


;;General bounds will be represented using vectors and meta data about the 
;;bound.  We'll use an arbitrary-length vector to communicate the extents of 
;;the bounded region.
