;;A library for defining entity behaviors.  Legacy implementation 
;;only covered unit entities, and used a Finite State Machine (FSM).
;;New implementation should be more general, and follows the Behavior 
;;Tree design as presented by A.J. Champagnard.
;;Revised notes:
;;Under the functional paradigm, behaviors are first-class state
;;transition functions.  They compose other first-class state
;;transitions functions to affect a change of state on the simstate.

;;We focus on associating the state transition in the unit/entity
;;behavior.  The other "system" behaviors act a coarse LOD, and really
;;only have one thing they're modifying, so they tend to be a little
;;simpler, BUT the concept is identical (as are the signatures).
;;The AI system is just a (either sequential or concurrent/differential)
;;composition of these independent entity systems.

;;Transitiong To Behavior Trees
;;=============================
;;Changing from the current policy-driven FSM, we need to start at the
;;choke-points so-to-speak, and then grow from there.  The nice thing
;;about behaviors is that they compose nicely....so you can build much
;;more complex behaviors from smaller, simpler behaviors.  We should
;;also be able to analyze, and possibly "compile" behavior trees at
;;some point.  For now though, we'll focus on building at least two
;;fundamental behaviors.

;;The philosophy behind our behavior tree is that the tree contains
;;all the possible actions a unit entity could take, inlcuding the
;;sequences and conditions (and joint conditions) therein.  The tree
;;should structure the logic of our entity's behavior such that its
;;depth-first traversal embodies the "hierarchy" of concerns for the
;;entity.  Typically, the AI folks will dictate that this is analagous
;;to the hierarchy of needs;  higher-priority needs occur earlier in
;;the tree;  With our naive tree, we always check from the root and
;;traverse until a stopping criterion is met;  this means we can
;;accomplish the same reactive "philosophy" of the existing FSM;
;;we should be able to make simple changes to the state of our
;;entity, and the behavior tree - upon re-evaluation - should be
;;able to suss out what it should be doing.


;;One strategy could be to isolate the state-independent parts of the 
;;existing logic and identify them as behaviors; in other words, 
;;remove all state-changes.  We then have the idiom of defining 
;;small, self-contained behaviors, and where we previously "wanted"
;;a state change, we realize a sequence of the simple behavior, 
;;and the state change.

;;This doesn't refactor anything, but it does allow us to translate
;;fairly directly to a behavior tree representation.

;;For instance, the control flow of the Moving state would establish
;;the context of a move based on policy, and then evaluate an
;;instantaneous call to ChangeState afterwards.  We can view that 
;;as a behavior like the following: 
;;               Moving         
;;[SetNextMove SetWaitTime LogMove WaitInNextState]

;;So one strategy is to just break out all of the implicit unit entity
;;state changes we're performing and them build our behaviors out 
;;of them.  As we go along, we can re-use previous actions, or 
;;where apprioriate, entire behaviors.

;;We may give some thoughts to extensions for our naive behavior tree
;;as well: 
;;  Behavior zippers (so we can remember the path we followed to our
;;                    current child)
;;  Specific types that denote success, running, failure


;;Implementation
;;==============

;;For now, we'll let the behavior tree assume it has everything it
;;needs in its context. 
;;The context is a simple map; we may move to a record type as an
;;optimization later, particularly if there are well-known fields 
;;that we'll be accessing frequently.  The context acts as a
;;"blackboard" for the nodes in the behavior tree to work with.

;;Note-> there are opportunities for using STM and exploiting
;;parallelism here; if we implement a parallel node, we may 
;;enjoy the benefits of "fast" entity updates.  On the other hand, 
;;since supply updating takes the preponderance of our time, 
;;we can still get a lot of bang-for-the-buck by updating individual
;;units in parallel batches.  Parallelizing the behavior tree may 
;;not be all that necessary.

;;Note: if we do implement a parallel node (even if executed
;;serially), we can have competing concerns executed in parallel 
;;(i.e. listen for messages, and also update over time slices).
