;;Bellman-ford works similarly to Djikstra, in that there is a fringe, 
;;a relaxation step, a value or distance function, etc.

;Given a directed acyclic graph, with no negative cycles, Bellman-Ford is 
;guaranteed to build the shortest path[s] from a start node to a source node 
;in O(VE) time, probably less if not all nodes have to be examined.

;In a way Bellman-Ford is very-much like Djikstra....
;  It has a fringe of nodes.
;  It allows for revision of the shortest path tree.
;  It allows a node 

;  Bellman-Ford differs in a couple of important respects:
;    It does not use priority to determine which nodes to inspect.
;    It does not assume a node has 

;Search algorithm implementation:
;I am intentionally verbose in the decomposition of functionality and in 
;comments.  I'll try to bake it into a more elegant form in the near future.

   1: sink is a newly discovered-node (as a consequence of visiting source);
   2: sink was visited earlier (from a different source), but this visit exposes
      a shorter path to sink, so it should be elevated in consideration in 
      the search fringe.
   3: sink is a node of equal length to the currently shortest-known path from
