;;Generic Neighborhoods
;;=====================

;;Given a solution representation, from spork.opt.representation/defsolution or
;;a compatible means, we would like to define ways to permute the solutions 
;;according to some strategy.  As our solution representations efficiently
;;map complex variable domains to an underlying normalized representation, we 
;;can define neighborhood functions as either manipulations of the normalized 
;;form, or as transforms of the "nicer" solution domain.  

;;Randomly Sampled Neighborhoods
;;==============================

;;The simplest neighborhood is to range over the normalized form of the 
;;solution, in each dimension, using a uniform distribution.  The normal form 
;;is defined specifically to make this easy to do.  Since the solution takes 
;;care of encoding everything, any range-based constraints will enforced 
;;automatically.
