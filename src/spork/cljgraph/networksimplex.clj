;;Applying the simplex method to the mincost flow 
;;problem requires a few extra bits of plumbing.

;;Our goal is identical to the primal simplex method 
;;using matrics in linear programming, except we have 
;;the ability to take advantage of special structures in 
;;the network representation for extra efficiency.


;;We need to compute node potentials. 
;;Node potentials form a heuristic for defining 
;;reduced cost.  Reduced cost is the actual (i.e. 
;;static) cost of 1 unit of flow across a node, 
;;less the difference between entering and 
;;leaving node potentials.  It's a heurstic to 
;;help us identify arcs we want to flow across.

;;We can interpret RC as the cost of buying at 
;;a node, shipping from the node to another, then 
;;selling (i.e. recouping cost) at the other node.

;;Thus, reduced cost informs how much we may improve 
;;the objective, based on potentials.
(defrecord simplex-net [net source sink tree potentials lower upper valids])

;;Our basis-tree is a minimum spanning tree, with the property 
;;that edges in the tree have a reduced cost of 0 (they are basic 
;;in simplex parlance). 

;;The general idea is to find a basic solution, which implies 
;;arcs outside of the basis.  We choose an arc outside of the 
;;basis and add it to the tree.  Adding it to the tree forms 
;;a cycle (since it's an MSP), which means we push flow 
;;along the cycle - ala cycle cancelling.  Some arc in the 
;;cycle is guaranteed to drop since flow is push.  So...we 
;;drop the arc, and recompute node potentials.  Then choose 
;;another arc outside of the tree.

;;When choosing an arc outside the tree, we can only choose arcs 
;;that will induce a negative-cost cycle in the basis.  What 
;;would do that?  Since the RC of every edge in the basis-tree 
;;is zero, we want to pull in an arc that, when flow is pushed 
;;along it, will result in a negative cost (.i.e improving the 
;;objective) in the residual network.

;;Since arcs may flow forward or backward, we are looking for 
;;forward, fully capacitated arcs that have positive reduced cost
;;(implying a backward residual arc with NEGATIVE cost), 
;;or empty arcs with negative reduced cost (implying a forward 
;;residual arc with NEGATIVE reduced cost).

;;We have an optimal flow if we cannot find an eligible arc.

;;The consequence here is that we are flipping through simplex 
;;bases, where the bases correspond to MSP trees for the flow network, 
;;transitions between trees force an arc out of the network and into 
;;either the Full or Empty arc set, while swapping in an arc from the 
;;Full or Empty arc set.

;;Each MSP has a unique set of vertex potentials.  So when we 
;;build an MSP (or mutate one), we need to recompute the vertex
;;potentials.

;;Actually, we need to recompute vertex potentials iff the old
;;potentials were affected.  There are cases where we will modify 
;;the MSP, but dependent potentials are unaffected (i.e. they are 
;;still good), so we can avoid recomputing all vertex potentials 
;;every time.

;;All we have to do to compute potentials is start at any node, 
;;traverse up through its parents, then when we hit the root (a node 
;;with no parent), we assign a potential to the parent (typically
;;-inf) and traverse back through the children assigning potentials.

;;Given rc(u,v) = cost(u,v) - (phi(u) - phi(v)) 
;;If we assume rc(u,v) = 0, for edges along the tree, 
;;then 0 = cost(u,v) - (phi(u) - phi(v))
;;     0 = cost(u,v) - phi(u) + phi(v)
;;     phi(u) - cost(u,v) = phi(v)

;;So, computing potentials for a child v relative to a parent u, for
;;any edeg (u,v) within the basis tree is:
;;     phi(v) = phi(u) - cost(u,v) 

;;There is a chance to optimize this bad-boy too; We can recompute 
;;potentials lazily.

;;If implement Danztig's rule, we scan all the arcs for the greatest

;;Another option is to maintain two arc sets.  
;;Since the residual network is stored implicitly, we can also 
;;store our bounded arcs implicitly.  Either that, or we 
;;can directly link to them.

;;Since we only maintain forward arcs for the undirected network
;;explicitly, backward (or residual) arcs are implied.  We store
;;keys that assoc to them when they exist, but the pointer goes to the 
;;forward arc. 

;;So all arc modifications are done on forward arcs.  The API takes 
;;care of understanding what it means to push a directional flow 
;;along an arc (i.e. it will infer that the arc is backward based on 
;;the direction we're going).

;;So we can push arcs between L and U. 
;;We can maintain three sets of forward arcs, T, L, U.
;;Arcs in T are on the basis, (forward and residual)
;;Arcs in L are zero-flow, off the basis. (not residual)
;;Arcs in U are full-flow, off the basis. (not residual)

;;Prior to pivoting, we need to identify the entering arc.
;;Assume we can do this...(get-entering-arc s) 
;;Then we identify the cycle.... 
;;(find-cycle (get-entering-arc s) (get-spt s))
;;Then we augment along the cycle, returning an augmentation:
;;(augment-cycle s (find-cycle (get-entering-arc s) (get-spt s)))
;;=> {:augmented-flow n :entering some-arc :leaving some-arc :net altered-network}


;;So, the first cut is to collect arcs that are off the basis.
;;We do this when we initially build the simplex.
;;traverse the SPT and collect arcs that are off the basis.
;;Initially, all non-basic arcs will be in L (zero flow).
