;;TODO
;;====
;;We should define combinators for networks.  In other words, they
;;should compose...
;;For instance, we can model a slew of phenomena via composition.
;;An network, with a source node and a terminal node, may be 
;;seen as an edge, whose capacity is determined by a maxflow.  
;;We can compose MCF and MAxflow problems into larger, more
;;sophisticated flow problems by building networks.
;;For instance, one design problem I was faced with was scaling 
;;a network.  How easy would that have been to compose with a 
;;scaling edge to the source and a scaling edge from the sink 
;;of a network?  I think that's a great way to go in the future, 
;;and it significantly differs from canonical flow implementations.
;;It would allow us to define network optimization models at a 
;;much higher level of abstraction.  I think that'd be pretty kickass.
